julia
=====

This is a utility created "just for fun" to draw [Julia sets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).
Currently it only draws filled Julia sets, and has no UI to speak of.

TODO:
 * some kind of parallellism
 * pretty colours (or just more than one shade of grey)
 * allow for computation of Julia sets of more general functions
